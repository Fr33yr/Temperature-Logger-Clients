📡 Project Hub – Multi-Client, Server, and NodeMCU Integration
This repository serves as a central hub for managing and linking the various components of our project, including mobile and desktop clients, the Node.js server, and firmware for the NodeMCU board. Each component plays a crucial role in data collection, processing, and visualization.

📱 Mobile Client
Built with: Kotlin (Jetpack Compose)
Purpose: Provides a responsive and intuitive interface to display real-time data collected from the NodeMCU. Allows users to interact with the system on the go.
🖥️ Desktop Client
Built with: Tauri and React
Purpose: Desktop version for a more immersive data visualization experience, leveraging the performance of Tauri to create lightweight yet powerful applications.
🖧 Node.js Server
Built with: Node.js (Express)
Purpose: Acts as the backend, handling communication between clients and the NodeMCU. Responsible for data storage, processing, and ensuring consistent synchronization across platforms.
🔌 NodeMCU Firmware
Built with: C++ (Arduino Framework)
Purpose: Directly interfaces with sensors and hardware, collecting data and sending it to the server. Forms the core of the data acquisition process.
